# Login with BitClout

BitClout recently moved to more secure login scheme that allows users to login while keeping their seed phrases private.

I was curious how this login mechanism could work for 3rd party applications.

I built this very simple prototype to test how login might work.

I deconstructed the front end code from the BitClout.com website and created a login mechanism for any website.

The code currently updates the page with public key of the logged in user, but this information can be used in many ways.

Feel free to reach out on with any questions: [@mubashariqbal](https://bitclout.com/u/mubashariqbal)

Disclaimer: I'm not primarily a frontend engineer, I'm sure this code could be much improved!
